# Graphlet_Representativity

run with :
  python main.py [folder] [k] [n]

Enumerate the graphlets of size [k (4 or 5)] of the graphs contained in [folder].
Compute the Graphlet Representativity.
Group the graph in [n] clusters using the k-means algorithm.
Produce a vizualisation of the resulting clusters.

the resulting folder is created in ../Results
